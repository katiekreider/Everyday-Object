<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Growing up, my dad, brother and I used to sit around listening to music for hours upon hours, even when I was really young. When I went off to college, my dad gave me his entire vinyl collection, and thatâ€™s when my love for records began. They would make me feel connected to home while I was away, and I would put on my family's favorites whenever I felt homesick. That's when my collection started, and it has now grown to about 150 records.</p>
